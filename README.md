# 🦙 Fine-Tuning LLaMA 3 (2.3B) with LoRA for Customer Support Chatbot
This project is about fine-tuning Meta’s LLaMA 3 2.3B Instruct model using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to build a custom chatbot for handling customer support queries. The idea is to make the model more aligned with support-specific conversations using an efficient and lightweight fine-tuning method.

🔍 Why I Did This
Large language models are powerful, but not always great out-of-the-box for specific tasks like customer support. I wanted to explore how much we can improve the relevance and tone of the model’s responses by fine-tuning it with domain-specific data — and LoRA seemed like the perfect way to do this without needing massive compute.

🧠 Model & Tools Used
Base Model: meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-2.3B-Instruct

Fine-Tuning Method: LoRA (with PEFT library)

Frameworks & Tools: Hugging Face Transformers, Datasets, PEFT, bitsandbytes, Accelerate

Everything is done in PyTorch and runs well on Colab or any local GPU setup with float16 support.

🛠️ How It Works
The notebook walks through the following steps:

Loads the LLaMA 3 2.3B Instruct model in 8-bit mode

Prepares a small set of customer queries and responses for fine-tuning

Formats prompts using an instruction-based template

Applies LoRA to selectively fine-tune attention layers

Trains the model using Hugging Face’s Trainer API

LoRA Config I Used
r: 64

alpha: 16

dropout: 0.05

📊 Dataset
For now, it’s a simple set of customer support Q&A pairs. You can easily extend it by adding your own data. The prompt formatting logic is customizable inside the generate_prompt() function.

🧪 Results
After fine-tuning, I tested the model with a few sample queries. It responded much better — more polite, to the point, and actually helpful (unlike the base model, which tended to ramble or go off-topic).

📌 Future Ideas
Try it on real support chat logs or ticket data

Add an evaluation script to score helpfulness

Package it into an API or streamlit chatbot UI
